<!-- ngrok is used for secure tunnel so our jenkins server behind our firewall can be accessed from GitHub. When the tests are added and a pull request is submitted an automatic jenkins build is initiated. When that build is successful or failed it will automatically get updated in the Readme. We are using a jenkins plugin that uses API's to update the status of the jenkins build.-->

### Getting Started

Clone CastleTools.git and CastleProducts.git:
```shell session
$ cd /scratch
$ git clone git@github.com:BoseCorp/CastleTools.git
$ PATH=$PATH:/scratch/CastleTools/bin   # add this to your ~/.profile, ~/.bash_profile or ~/.login
$ git clone git@github.com:BoseCorp/CastleProducts.git
$ git checkout taylor/master
```

Make sure your Taylor unit is accessible via adb.
```shell session
$ sudo adb start-server             # must be done as root. typically once per boot of the build host
$ adb devices
List of devices attached
5166240	device

$
```

If you have multiple Android devices, you can set the ANDROID_SERIAL environment
variable to select a specific device:

```
export ANDROID_SERIAL=5166240
```

(Some scripts will not work correctly if you don't do that.)

Access the APQ console via the tap cable.

```shell session
$ cat /etc/minirc.usb0
pr port             /dev/ttyUSB0
pu baudrate         115200
pu bits             8
pu parity           N
pu stopbits         1
pu minit
pu mreset
pu mhangup
pu rtscts           No
pu logfname         /dev/null
$ minicom -w -C minicom.cap usb0
```

Use `dmesg` to see if your tap cable is actually USB0.

If you use `adb shell` to login, you won't have the usual environment by
default.  To setup the usual environment:

```shell session
$ adb shell
Sat Sep  2 12:10:12 UTC 2017
Device name: "Bose SoundTouch C7E3A2"
mc1014468@hepdsw64.bose.com 2017-08-31T08:40:21 master 0.0.1-1+3e07c68
#
# type start
start is /opt/Bose/bin/start
#
```

Certain important error and status messages go only to the console.
You generally won't see this information via `adb shell`.

To enable development mode:

```shell session
# mount -oremount,rw /persist
# mfgdata set development true
# mount -oremount,ro /persist
```

This flag enables core dumps, telnet access and other debug features.
In particular, if a daemon dies unexpectedly, no automatic recovery
happens when development mode is enabled.

To perform Bonjour-Update; use the pushup script:

From the Taylor workspace:

```shell session
$ cd /scratch/Taylor
$ pip2.7 install -r Test/requirements.txt
$ make all-packages
```

```shell session
To update without HSP:
$ ./scripts/pushup

To update HSP:
$ ./scripts/pushup --hsp

When having multiple devices, without HSP:
$ ./scripts/pushup --deviceid <deviceid>

When having multiple devices, with HSP:
$ ./scripts/pushup --deviceid <deviceid> --hsp
```

In general:

```shell session
$ cd /scratch
$ git clone git@github.com:BoseCorp/CastleTestUtils.git
$ cd CastleTestUtils
$ pip2.7 install -r requirements.txt
$ ./CastleTestUtils/scripts/pushup --deviceid <device-id> --zipfile <path-to-zipfile>
```

### Initial Installation on Development Units

In your Taylor workspace:

```shell session
$ cd /scratch/Taylor
$ adb shell mount -oremount,rw /opt/Bose
$ adb push opt-bose-fs/.bashrc /opt/Bose
$ adb push opt-bose-fs/.bash_profile /opt/Bose
$ adb push opt-bose-fs/etc/product /opt/Bose/etc
$ make product-ipk
$ ./scripts/upstage
```

On the Taylor unit:

```shell session
# [ -e /persist/mfg_data.json ] || mfgdata clear
# mfgdata set development true
# validate-mfgdata
...make the corrections suggested by validate-mfgdata (including running sadi)...
# validate-mfgdata && echo good to go || echo needs more work
```

Now reboot and you should see the usual daemons start.

### Software Updates

Different ways to perform Software Update are:

#### Bonjour update

To update the software (SoundTouch, HSP, LPM, etc) as a user, it is highly recommended to use Bonjour.
Follow the instructions found on the wiki: [Bonjour Update of Eddie](https://wiki.bose.com/display/WSSW/Bonjour+Update+of+Eddie).

For a simpler-way; see ./pushup script.

To update the software, along with HSP, use product_update.zip file. To update
the software, without HSP update (recommended only if HSP version you are
updating to, is same as one on device), use product_update_no_hsp.zip.

##### Special instructions to downgrade MR4 / MR1 to SOS Release
SOP, SOS and MR4 have following HSP versios.
* SOP: HSP 3.10.3
* SOS: HSP 3.10.5
* MR4: HSP 4.1 (or higher)

To optimize Out of Box update opeation to smallest time possible, SOP to SOS HSP performs only "kernel" update. Other file system space and partitions remain same between 3.10.3 to 3.10.5. This works as intended, though has side effect for those who wants to downgrade from higher HSP versions to SOS e.g. from MR4 to SOS - for development / testing purposes.

To downgrade to SOS release, one need to use update package specially made for downgrade operation at *\\solid\softlib\verisoft\Eddie\Release\SOS\<Release 2.0.5-5531+d50e0d4 or higher>\forDowngrade\product_update_for_downgrade.zip.*

**If builds higher then SOS (i.e. builds with HSP 4.x or higher) are downgraded using \\solid\softlib\verisoft\Eddie\Release\SOS\<Release>\product_update.zip, device will potetially be bricked and will enter in QFIL mode. Please see instructions below about QFIL / VIP to recover such device.**

#### QFIL / VIP

If you suspect your system is not in correct state that Bonjour update can
work or it no longer boots, please use QFIL / VIP programming. Follow the
instructions found on the wiki: [Recoverying A Bricked
Eddie](https://wiki.bose.com/display/WSSW/Recovering+A+Bricked+Eddie).

#### push-to-target Script

In case if you do not want to perform full software update and just copy
binaries/libraries related to your module you can use push-to-target script
under scripts directory.  Example usage:

1. Let say you want to push Software update module binaries to your device [same way you can use -l for libraries and -c for config files]

```shell session
    push-to-target -b SoftwareUpdateService [-i ADB_device_id] [-r reset_device]
```

2. Let say you want to push Software Update components(libraries, binaries and configuration files) to your device

```shell session
    push-to-target -m SoftwareUpdate [-i ADB_device_id] [-r reset_device]
```

3. Let say you want to push Software Update as well as NetManager components to your device

```shell session
    push-to-target -m SoftwareUpdate NetManager [-i ADB_device_id] [-r reset_device]
```

4. You can copy all the binaries built in you local system using

```shell session
    push-to-target -a [-i ADB_device_id] [-r reset_device]
```

Please note that this script will stop all services in your device so you will
need to restart all services after copy or you can just use -r option to reset
device after push operation.

### Building different LPM BLOBs

By default the BLOB that is used to create the lpm_updater.ipk will be a
Release BLOB based off of the release manifest xml located in the
LpmManifestFiles directory. If you wish to create a BLOB based on Continuous
or Nightly builds of components try building with the commands below:

```shell session
# Install components and run make normally
$ make
# After running make you can now create different types of LPM BLOBs

# Create a BLOB using the LpmManifestFiles/continuous_lpm_package.xml
$ make lpmupdater-ipk BUILD_TYPE=Continuous

# Create a BLOB using the LpmManifestFiles/nightly_lpm_package.xml
$ make lpmupdater-ipk BUILD_TYPE=Nightly

# Create a BLOB using the LpmManifestFiles/release_lpm_package.xml
# Note: By default the build process will use this method.
$ make lpmupdater-ipk BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

### PTS Server Links

The PTS Server is a tiny embedded web server.  The server was originally
intended for information to investigate customer problems reported to the
technical support team.  The server has evolved to have a broader purpose.

For security reasons, some endpoints are accessible only via certain
interfaces.  For testing, you can disable this
restriction: `touch /mnt/nv/product-persistence/anyiface`.

| Interface | Endpoint | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| usb | /diag | Quality Audit |
| any | /logread.txt | A snapshot of the system log ring buffer, dmesg and pts.txt * |
| any | /logread.txt.gz | Same as /logread.txt but compressed * |
| any | /pts.txt | Various Linux and system status information (e.g., ifconfig) * |
| any | /pts.dat | Same as /pts.txt but encrypted ** |
| any | /logread.dat | Same as /logread.txt but encrypted ** |
| usb | /reflash | Force the unit into reflash mode (QFIL) |
| usb | /bose-version | /opt/Bose/etc/BoseVersion.json |
| usb | /kernel-version | /etc/riviera-version |
| usb | /validate-mfgdata | Check the manufacturing data |
| usb | /controller-version | The LPM version strings |
| usb | /clear-first-greeting | Clear the flag indicating the unit's first boot |
| any | /opensource | List the licenses of open source software used in the system |
| any | /service | Remanufacturing. Only if the unit is in service mode |
| any | /dev | Developer links * |
| usb, wlan1 | /, /index.html | Wi-Fi setup |

\* Only if the unit is in development mode
