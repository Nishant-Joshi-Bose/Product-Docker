<!-- ngrok is used for secure tunnel so our jenkins server behind our firewall can be accessed from GitHub. When the tests are added and a pull request is submitted an automatic jenkins build is initiated. When that build is successful or failed it will automatically get updated in the Readme. We are using a jenkins plugin that uses API's to update the status of the jenkins build.-->

### Getting Started

Checkout CastleTools.git and Eddie.git:
```shell session
$ cd /scratch
$ git clone git@github.com:BoseCorp/CastleTools.git
$ PATH=$PATH:/scratch/CastleTools/bin   # add this to your ~/.profile, ~/.bash_profile or ~/.login
$ git clone git@github.com:BoseCorp/Eddie.git
```

Build the .ipk package file containing the SoundTouch software.
```shell session
$ cd /scratch/Eddie
$ make
```

Make sure your Eddie unit is accessible via adb.
```shell session
$ sudo adb start-server             # must be done as root. typically once per boot of the build host
$ adb devices
List of devices attached
5166240	device

$
```

Install the .ipk file you built.
```shell session
$ adb shell /opt/Bose/bin/stop      # generally it's okay if this fails
$ adb shell /opt/Bose/bin/rw        # make the file systems writeable
$ adb shell opkg remove SoundTouch  # this too may fail
$ adb push builds/Release/product.ipk /tmp/product.ipk
$ adb shell opkg install -d bose /tmp/product.ipk
$ adb shell reboot
```
(But see `putipk` below for a simpler way.)

You'll get a notification if your Riviera unit is running old Riviera software:
```shell session
...
Built for Riviera-HSP: 0.5-9-geee2c72
Installed Riviera-HSP: 0.5-7-g856bf73
...
```

To update the HSP, see the next section.

### Reflashing the Riviera HSP

To reflash the Riviera HSP:
```shell session
$ cd /scratch/Eddie
$ components install
$ adb shell reboot bootloader       # reboot the Riviera unit into the fastboot bootloader
$ sudo fastboot devices             # make sure the unit is in the bootloader
$ cd `components get Riviera-HSP-Images installed_location`/images
$ sudo ./fastboot.sh
$ sudo fastboot reboot
```

<a name="lpm"/>

### Updating LPM from APQ using IPK

To update LPM from APQ:
```shell session
$ cd /scratch/Eddie
$ ./scripts/putlpm  # Install LPM ipk from the latest Continuous master build
$ ./scripts/putlpm ./builds/Release/lpm_updater.ipk # Install LPM ipk generated by make package
$ ./scripts/putlpm <path-to-lpm-ipk> # Install a specific LPM ipk  
```

Please Note: Check your current LPM version using the vr command on LPM TAP. If LPM version is 
older than 0.0.4.1163, please install the LPM ipk twice following the above steps.
For subsequent new LPM ipk installs, just installing the ipk once should be sufficient.

### More...

To rebuild the .ipk file and install via adb in one step:

```shell session
$ ./scripts/putipk jobs=4
```

Access the APQ console via the tap cable.

```shell session
$ cat /etc/minirc.usb0
pr port             /dev/ttyUSB0
pu baudrate         115200
pu bits             8
pu parity           N
pu stopbits         1
pu minit
pu mreset
pu mhangup
pu rtscts           No
pu logfname         /dev/null
$ minicom -w -C minicom.cap usb0
```

Use `dmesg` to see if your tap cable is actually USB0.

If you use `adb shell` to login, you won't have the usual environment by default.
To setup the usual environment:

```shell session
$ adb shell
/ # . ~/.profile
Sat Sep  2 12:10:12 UTC 2017
Device name: "Bose SoundTouch C7E3A2"
mc1014468@hepdsw64.bose.com 2017-08-31T08:40:21 master 0.0.1-1+3e07c68
#
# type start
start is /opt/Bose/bin/start
#
```

Certain important error and status messages go only to the console.
You generally won't see this information via `adb shell`.
