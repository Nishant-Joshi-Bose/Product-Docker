This directory contains a script and associated files to generate the
Open Source Licenses disclosure document which is now an HTML table
instead of just a text file.  Note that the license files generated
with 'npm run license-aggregation' are checked in for reference only;
they are not processed as part of the build (at least not yet).  The
following files are included in this directory:

  o brussels-licenses.txt: generated with 'npm run license-aggregation' 
  o dinghy-licenses.txt: LICENSES.md from Igalia-buildroot-bose repo
  o eula.html: manually converted from eula.txt
  o eula.txt: file obtained from MAUI team
  o flamenco-licenses.txt: generated with 'npm run license-aggregation'
  o monaco-licenses.txt: generated with 'npm run license-aggregation'
  o projects: license files from all manually added projects
  o README: this file
  o riviera-licenses: Perl script that creates license disclosure document
