        *   To cause an image to be compressed, provide a nonzero hs_window and/or
            hs_lookahead. If not included, 0 (not compressed) will be assumed.

        *   'version' may be a hardcoded version, 'dynamic' or 'filename'. If
            version=filename the script will use the longest string of numbers
            and periods in the file name as the version number. If
            version=dynamic a properties file is searched for and parsed, and
            if that fails it falls back to the 'filename' approach.

        *   *ROOT* may be used in the path attribute. It will be resolved to the root
            directory of the project, provided to the script.

        *   *CNR* may be used in the path attribute. It will be resolved as "Continuous",
            "Nightly", or "Release", based on parameters passed to the script.

        *   The 'path' attribute may consist of multiple paths separated by commas.
            The first of these paths to match to a real file will be used.

        *   The string "REGEX:" at the beginning of a path will cause the file name
            portion to be treated like a regex, and matched against files in the
            directory. If REGEX: is not used, an asterisk (*) can still be used as a
            wildcard to match characters. If either of these methods match more than one
            file, the program will exit with an error.
