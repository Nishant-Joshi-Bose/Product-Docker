# For release builds, we want to the timestamp of the BLOB to reflect that last time the manifest XML file was modified in git. This
# allows for the BLOB version (which includes a timestamp) to stay static across builds where the contents of the BLOB does not change.
# The main draw back is the case where someone changes the the release manifest XML locally and re-builds. In this case, since the changes
# to the manifest file have not been committed in git the timestamp will remain the same instead of changing. To work around this,
# developers will need to remember to bump the version of the BLOB (minor or major revision) in order to generate a BLOB with a different version.

# Nightly builds and continuous builds will use the current time during as the timestamp.
